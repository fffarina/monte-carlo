    "# Summary\n",
    "The _stochastic simulation algorithm_ (SSA) was developed over the twentieth century, like most other MC methods. A sizeable fraction of the literature is dedicated to either improving it's complexity, or implementing it to investigate the properties of Markov processes. Here, the SSA is formulated in the introduction, two versions are written with Python 3 in the implementation section, and these are used in the applications section to simulate a simple epidemic, and enzymatic reaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that the SSA has been well-formulated in probability theory for a good deal of time, but in the context of this discussion, it was first described in 1976 by Daniel T. Gillespie as _a systematic, computer-oriented procedure in which rigorously derived Monte Carlo techniques are employed to numerically simulate \\[Markov processes\\]._ In Gillespie's works, the SSA was implemented to simulate processes known as reactive chemical mixtures. In such processes, a set of chemical species spontaneously form and break bonds with each other following a so-called stoichiometry, which can be quite simple (i.e. the reaction has a single elementary event), or be inoordinately complex (i.e. the reaction has many thousands of elementary events).\n",
    "\n",
    "In any reactive chemical mixture, each elementary event has a so-called propensity, and this propensity depends on the composition (i.e. the set of chemical species) at any point in time during the reaction. In their works on SSA, Gillespie derives propensity expressions from first principals for certain kinds of elementary events, which are then used to simulate certain reactive chemical mixtures. The extension of propensities to elementary events of any Markov process is generally always possible, but their derivation must be handled with care to produce accurate simulation results (i.e. dimensional analysis must be utilized in a coherent manner).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of reactive chemical mixtures, dependence on the system's composition by propensity $c$ is usually denoted by viewing it as an evaluated function, $c(x_{t})$, where $x_{t}$ is the vector of species counts at the time of the reaction. Further, for one of the countable numbers of elementary events, $j$, it's propensity is denoted $c_{j}(x_{t})$. Now, the so-called _fundamental hypothesis of the stochastic formulation of chemical kinetics_ endows propensities with the following property: $c_{j}(x_{t}) \\delta t + o(\\delta t)$ is defined as the average probability, to first order in $\\delta t$, that elementary reaction $j$ will occur in the next time interval $\\delta t$, where $j$ refers to the index of the elementary event (exercise: give the dimension of $c_{j}(x_{t})$). This probabilistic interpretation of each $c_{j}(x_{t})$ means that $j$ is a random variable, such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(j) = \\frac{c_{j}(x_{t})}{\\sum_{j}c_{j}(x_{t})},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can be exploited in a Monte-Carlo step in an alogirthm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next consideration in formulating the SSA is to find a probabilistic expression for the _time to the next elementary event_, $\\tau$. In queuing theory $\\tau$ is called the _sojourn time_. In basically _every single_ Markov process, the sojourn time, is exponentially distributed. So then\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p(\\tau) = exp(-\\sum_{j}c_{j}(x_{t})\\tau),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which can also be exploited in a Monte-Carlo step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above two probability functions comprise the basic considerations of the SSA, though in the literature they are not introduced in this factorized manner. Notwithstanding, these distribution functions imply the SSA simulates a Markov process by considering two simple, but really interesting random variables-- $j$ (the next elementary event) and $\\tau$ (the time, or sojourn, until the next event). Boiling down emperical processes, however complicated, into two simple random variables is one of the most delightful and curious results of numerical science research. Consider next the MC steps for these two random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no prescription for how elementary events are ordered as the domain of $p(j)$-- it is in practice usually a matter of convenience. Nevertheless, it is important that each elementary event be hashed to only one $j$ throughout the simulation, and that each elementary event have a fixed place relative to others, so long as it is a valid event. To update populations the following \"inversion step\" is evaluated with a pseudorandom float, $r$, on $[0,1]$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$j = \\text{the smallest integer satisfying} \\sum_{i=1}^{j} c_{i}(x_{t}) > r\\sum_{j}c_{j}(x_{t})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the sojourn time, the familiar exponential distribution inversion is invoked with another pseudorandom float on $[0,1]$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tau = \\frac{1}{\\sum_{j}c_{j}(x_{t})}log_{e}(\\frac{1}{r})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These MC steps pertain to the so-called \"direct-method\" of the SSA, which is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the time $t = t_{0}$ and systems state to $x=x_{0}$\n",
    "2. Evaluate each $c_{j}$ if it depends on $x$ or $t$, and compute $\\sum_{j}c_{j}(x_{t})$\n",
    "3. Evaluate the Monte Carlo steps to update $t$ and $x$\n",
    "4. Update $t$ and $x$ as desired\n",
    "5. Return to step 2 or else exit the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "There is as well the \"first-reaction\" method of the SSA, which discounts all the theory behind the direct method presented above (Gillespie tends to motivate the SSA with the direct method). It is as follows (exercise: explain why this version works):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize the time $t = t_{0}$ and systems state to $x=x_{0}$\n",
    "2. Draw $j$ pseudorandom numbers and compute a $\\hat{\\tau}$ with each one\n",
    "3. Set $\\tau$ as the smallest $\\hat{\\tau}$, and $j$ as the index of the chosen $\\hat{\\tau}$\n",
    "4. Update $t$ and $x$ as desired\n",
    "5. Return to step 2 or else exit the simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implementation\n",
    "The SSAs as presented above follow the literautre published by Gillespie, but are naive in at least one respect: they don't specify how to avoid updating the system's categorical populations in nonsensical ways. For example, without certain precautions, it could be possible for a given species' population to dip below zero, which is nonsense. This can be resolved by implementing additional logic that regulates populations, the possible/impossible elementary events, and determines when a simulation should be complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A container for all the \"unimportant\" logic, `SSAModel`\n",
    "As a sufficiently general approach to such logic, consider the following \"model\" class, inhereting from a built-in dictionary, which was designed to offload the control-flow issues described in the above paragraph from the SSAs to itself, thus reducing those tasks to single calls to it's public members. Detailed functionality is given by a full breakdown of each member after the source code."

Any initial condition (for time or otherwise) with more than one specified in it's iterable will have those additional conditions truncated, leading to possibly erroneous results.\n",
    " - The `propensities` dictionary contains $j$ key-value pairs, whereby each key is an integer $\\geq 1$ and $\\leq j$, and each value is a function that instances of `SSAModel` can pass themselves to, thus evaluating that elementary event's propensity.\n",

    "\n",

    "Regardless of the ontological aspects involved in Gillespie's work deriving the SSA, it is broadly applicable to many observable processes. Consider as an example an epidmeic somewhat similar to the COVID-19 pandemic, in which a population of individuals are all initially in a susceptible state ($S$), and eventually all transition to the infected ($I$) state by acquiring the virus, unless all infected individuals recover before another infection can occur. In the infected state, an individual eithers recover (state $R$) or dies. Further, supposing that the epidemic timescale is significantly shorter than the average lifespan of any individual, it can be assumed that any transitions from the recovered state are not possible. Schematically, here are the possibilities $S \\rightarrow I$, $I \\rightarrow D$, and $I \\rightarrow R$.\n",

Specifically, $S$'s time evolution is governed by $\\frac{dS}{dt} = -\\alpha S I$, $I$'s time evolution is governed by $\\frac{dI}{dt} = \\alpha S I - \\beta I - \\gamma I$, and $R$'s time evolution is governed by $\\frac{dR}{dt} = \\gamma I$.\n",

    "The epidemiological example above describes at a macroscopic level how biological materials like a virus interact with populations of biological organisms.  On a per-capita basis, a virus works by infecting certain of the organism's cells (i.e. cells of a particular tissue), whereby it enters a cell and integrates it's genetic material such that the cell will synthesize proteins with viral genetic information. These proteins are either viral particles that assemble directly to produce structural facets of the virus, or they are so-called _enzymes_, which catalyze chemical reactions related to the production of viral particles in the host cell.\n",

    "Enzymes also exist in uninfected cells, and they work to support normal cellular activity. Regardless of their purpose, they are in the simplest terms said to operate on one or more _substrates_ to help produce _products_. In the case of one substrate, an enzyme might interact with it to modify it's bond arrangement or _stereochemistry_. The enzymes that do this are called isomerases. Theoretically, this process happens as follows. Some number of substrate and some number of corresponding isomerase are floating around in a subcellular compartment, and when one substrate particle interacts appropriately with one isomerase, a substrate-isomerase complex is formed. The isomerase at that point will either catalyze the isomerization and dissociate from the substrate isomer (i.e. the product), or it will dissociate from the substrate without isomerizing it (exercise: with the stoiochiometry dictionary below, draw out the directed graphs for all possible elementary events, supposing $S$ is the substrate, $I$ is the isomerase, $C$ is the substrate-isomerase complex, and $p$ is the product).\n",
